# Commodore 64 stuff
I start my journey into 6502 assembly on the Commodore 64. I welcome you as my copilot :)

My goal is to go from 0 to demo production. First stop is Transmission64 2023!
Update 2024: New year, new goals!
Basic fader done for Transmission64, so let's look at something big: release something a X-Party 2024 and visit it in person (yeah, real live stuff).
Another update: got my ticket, started to work on something.
