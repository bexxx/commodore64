# Raster interrupt

This sample shows how to set up a raster interrupt to execute code at a specific position
of the raster beam on screen. 

The code in this example only sets the color of the border to a specific color and after some lines set it back to the original color.

With more precise timing this mechanism can be used to draw rasterbars.
