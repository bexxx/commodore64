# Fader for Transmission64, 2024

This is my second year at Transmission64. Last year it was the goal of the year and my first code release, now it's just another step :).

The fader itself was inspired by Viti^HF's size optimized plasma routine ([Plazmoid, 1k](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=241047)), which I looked at to start learning more about plasmas, but it got me into a detour ;). Viti was nice enough to explain his algorithm idea and I reimplemented it in a not as size optimal, but more readable version (ok, for beginners).

Because this code uses random values generated by the SID noice generator, it looks different on each start!
