# Size coding XMas Challenge 2021 
My contribution to the size coding challenge, but unfortunately I missed the deadline by a day
because I found the webpage too late. Anyway, I did ok, but have lots of room for improvement.

I tried to be clever (never works for me) and used self modifying code. However using slow print routines
from ROM are a better choice to save bytes.
